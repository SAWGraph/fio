# FIO

The Facilities and Industries Ontology provides a representation of facilities and their industry classification(s). It is extended by the FRS ontology that incorporates facilities in the US from EPA's facility registry service (https://www.epa.gov/frs) , and the NAICS and SIC ontologies that populate these two industry classification schemes.
